        "summary": "The drainage current J^μ = (c³/4πG)∇^μ ln(S/S₀) is derived from the T⁴/ℤ₂ topology of the universe. The universe is a 4-torus quotiented by an orientation-reversing ℤ₂ involution — a single non-orientable 4D manifold where M⁺ and M⁻ are perspectives, not separate places. The boundary Σ is the self-intersection surface populated by vortex tunnels. The Higgs field characterizes this pre-structure via its Compton wavelength λ_C(H) ≈ 10^-17 m. The 4π factor comes from spherical vortex arrangement. G is derived (not empirical) via G = ℏc/(m_H² · π^68), where the hierarchy π^34 ≈ 10^17 emerges from T⁴/ℤ₂ geometry.",
