# Safety Guidelines

**Hazards and precautions for EPS experiment operation**

---

## Hazard Summary

| Hazard | Risk Level | Location |
|--------|------------|----------|
| Vacuum implosion | Medium | Chamber, viewports |
| Electrical shock | Medium | Power supplies, GPUs |
| High temperature | Medium | Radiator, GPUs |
| Coolant leak | Low | Cooling loop |
| Laser exposure | Low | Optical readout |

## 1. Vacuum Safety

### Hazards
- Glass viewports can implode under vacuum
- Rapid venting can propel debris
- Pressure differentials can crush soft components

### Precautions
- [ ] Wear safety glasses when chamber is under vacuum
- [ ] Install viewport guards (polycarbonate shields)
- [ ] Install pressure relief valve (set to 1.1 atm)
- [ ] Vent slowly (< 100 mbar/min)
- [ ] Never apply force to chamber under vacuum
- [ ] Check all seals before pumping

### Emergency: Viewport Failure
1. Step back immediately
2. Allow pressure to equalize
3. Assess injuries
4. Do not re-enter area until debris cleared

---

## 2. Electrical Safety

### Hazards
- 5 kW power draw at 240V or multiple 120V circuits
- High currents (>40A total)
- Capacitors in power supplies retain charge

### Precautions
- [ ] All circuits protected by GFCI
- [ ] Main disconnect switch accessible
- [ ] Proper grounding verified
- [ ] No exposed conductors
- [ ] Cables rated for current load
- [ ] Strain relief on all connections

### Emergency: Electrical Fire
1. Activate main disconnect
2. Use CO₂ or dry chemical extinguisher (NOT water)
3. Evacuate if smoke significant
4. Call emergency services

---

## 3. Thermal Safety

### Hazards
- GPU heatsinks can exceed 80°C
- Radiator surface can exceed 100°C
- Coolant at elevated temperature

### Precautions
- [ ] Warning labels on hot surfaces
- [ ] Thermal gloves available
- [ ] Allow 30 min cooldown before maintenance
- [ ] Coolant temperature monitored
- [ ] Thermal runaway protection on GPUs

### Emergency: Burns
1. Cool affected area with water
2. Seek medical attention for burns > 1" diameter
3. Do not remove adhered clothing

---

## 4. Coolant Safety

### Hazards
- Liquid leak in electrical area
- Slipping hazard
- Potential pump seal failure

### Precautions
- [ ] Drip tray under cooling loop
- [ ] Leak detector with alarm
- [ ] Non-conductive coolant (distilled water + biocide)
- [ ] Daily visual inspection of connections

### Emergency: Major Leak
1. Power OFF all equipment
2. Close coolant valve (if accessible)
3. Disconnect power to pump
4. Mop up liquid
5. Investigate cause before restart

---

## 5. Laser Safety

### Hazards
- Class 3B HeNe laser (5 mW)
- Eye damage from direct or reflected beam

### Precautions
- [ ] Laser safety glasses available (OD >3 @ 632.8 nm)
- [ ] Beam path enclosed where possible
- [ ] Warning sign when laser active
- [ ] No reflective jewelry/watches in beam area

### Emergency: Eye Exposure
1. Do not rub eye
2. Seek immediate ophthalmological evaluation
3. Document exposure (power, duration, direct/reflected)

## Required Training

Before operating this experiment:

1. [ ] General lab safety (institutional requirement)
2. [ ] Vacuum system safety (from qualified operator)
3. [ ] Electrical safety for high-current systems
4. [ ] Laser safety awareness

---

## Incident Reporting

All incidents, near-misses, and equipment failures must be documented:

1. Stop work
2. Ensure personnel safety
3. Preserve scene (if safe)
4. Report to supervisor immediately
5. Complete written incident report within 24 hours

---

## Daily Safety Checklist

Before each experimental session:

- [ ] Fire extinguisher accessible and charged
- [ ] Emergency exits clear
- [ ] Safety glasses in lab
- [ ] Grounding straps connected
- [ ] Cooling system leak-free
- [ ] Vacuum system stable
- [ ] All personnel aware of today's activities
