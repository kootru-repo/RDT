## 1. Thermodynamic Gravity

### Jacobson's Result (1995)

Ted Jacobson showed that Einstein's field equations can be *derived* from:
- The Clausius relation: δQ = TδS
- The holographic principle: S ∝ A (entropy proportional to area)
- Local Lorentz invariance

**Implication:** Gravity may not be fundamental — it emerges from thermodynamics.

**Paper:** [arXiv:gr-qc/9504004](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9504004)

### Verlinde's Extension (2010)

Erik Verlinde proposed that gravitational force is literally an entropic force:

$$F = T \frac{\partial S}{\partial x}$$

Mass falling toward another mass increases the entropy of the holographic screen between them.

## 2. RDT Framework

Relational Drainage Theory provides a substrate for thermodynamic gravity:

### The Four Foundations

| Foundation | Statement |
|------------|-----------|
| F1 | Reality has finitely many configurations: \|Ω\| = N |
| F2 | Configurations have a distance metric: d: Ω×Ω → ℝ |
| F3 | Experience is traversal through Ω: γ: T → Ω |
| F4 | CPT symmetry: dual manifolds M⁺/M⁻ share boundary Σ |

### Key Addition: Dual Manifold

RDT postulates M⁺ (our universe) and M⁻ (CPT-mirror) sharing boundary Σ. This allows:
- Local entropy increase in M⁺
- Corresponding decrease in M⁻
- Total conservation: S⁺ + S⁻ = constant

---

## 3. EPS Derivation

### The Proposal

If gravity is entropic force (F = T∇S), then:
- Generating entropy asymmetrically
- Creates an entropy gradient
- Which produces thrust

### The Coupling Question

How strongly does entropy couple to spacetime? Define coupling κ:

$$F = \kappa \cdot T \cdot \frac{dS}{dx}$$

The κ value was unknown — estimates ranged from 1 to 10⁻⁴⁰.

### RDT Prediction

RDT's relational ontology (0D configurations, not extended objects) implies:

$$\kappa = \frac{1}{4\pi} \approx 0.08$$

### The Force Equation

For thermal radiation at power P:

$$F = \frac{P}{4\pi c} \approx 1 \text{ μN/kW}$$

---

## 4. Distinguishing Test

Photon pressure also produces thrust (~3.3 μN/kW). The distinguishing test:

**Vary temperature at constant power.**

| Effect | Temperature dependence |
|--------|------------------------|
| Photon pressure | F independent of T |
| EPS | F ∝ T |

If thrust scales with temperature, that's the EPS signature.

## 5. Momentum Conservation

### The Objection

"This violates conservation of momentum!"

### The Resolution

The system includes both M⁺ and M⁻:

```
Before:  p(M⁺) = 0,    p(M⁻) = 0      → Total = 0
After:   p(M⁺) = +Δp,  p(M⁻) = -Δp   → Total = 0 ✓
```

The "mirror mass" in M⁻ recoils oppositely.

### This is NOT "free energy"

- You pay for thrust with electricity (entropy generation costs power)
- Thermodynamics is satisfied (total entropy increases)
- This only works if the dual-manifold model is correct

## 6. Prior Art

| Work | Relevance |
|------|-----------|
| Jacobson (1995) | GR from thermodynamics |
| Verlinde (2010) | Gravity as entropic force |
| Boyle & Turok (2018) | CPT-symmetric cosmology |
| Landauer (1961) | Minimum energy for bit erasure |

## 7. What Success Would Mean

If EPS works at κ ≈ 1/4π:

1. **Thermodynamic gravity confirmed** — Verlinde was right
2. **Dual manifold exists** — RDT's M⁺/M⁻ structure is real
3. **Practical application** — Propellantless propulsion possible
4. **New physics** — First direct manipulation of spacetime structure

---

## 8. What Failure Would Mean

If null result at high precision:

1. κ << 1/4π — Portals are extended objects (not 0D)
2. Or κ = 0 — Entropy doesn't couple to spacetime this way
3. Or Verlinde's entropic gravity is wrong
4. Or M⁺/M⁻ coupling doesn't work as proposed

**Still valuable:** Constrains theoretical models
