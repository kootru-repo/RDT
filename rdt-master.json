  "elevator_pitch": "RDT proposes that spacetime, gravity, and quantum mechanics emerge from a finite configuration space (the 'possibilities block') equipped with a natural metric. The universe explores this space through thermodynamic drainage - paths of steepest entropy increase - which manifests as the arrow of time, gravitational attraction, and quantum uncertainty. A CPT-symmetric dual manifold ensures global conservation while permitting local irreversibility.",
