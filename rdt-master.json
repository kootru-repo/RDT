  "elevator_pitch": "RDT proposes that spacetime, gravity, and quantum mechanics emerge from a finite configuration space (the 'possibilities block') equipped with a natural metric. The universe is T⁴/ℤ₂ — an orientifold, a well-established construction in string theory. M⁺ and M⁻ are DUAL THEORIES (like T-duality), not separate universes. Σ is the O-plane locus where vortex tunnels (D-brane-like objects) allow entropy drainage. Gravity is entropy flow along this surface, and G is derived from the orientifold's π-governed topology.",

  "faq": {
    "string_theorists": {
      "question": "Where's the UV completion?",
      "answer": "RDT sidesteps UV divergences by construction: Ω is finite. There's no continuum to regularize. The 'Planck scale' emerges as minimum Ω-distance, not a cutoff imposed on underlying continuum."
    },
    "loop_quantum_gravity": {
      "question": "How does Lorentz invariance emerge?",
      "answer": "Like LQG's spin networks, RDT is background-independent. Lorentz symmetry emerges statistically from the metric d(σ,σ') on Ω at scales >> l_P."
    },
    "entropic_gravity_fans": {
      "question": "Finally someone building on Verlinde properly!",
      "answer": "RDT takes Jacobson (1995) and Verlinde (2010) seriously: gravity IS entropy gradient. We add the substrate (Ω with metric), dual manifold (M⁺/M⁻), and testable predictions (κ ≈ 1/4π)."
    },
    "phenomenologists": {
      "question": "Give me the κ experiment.",
      "answer": "See Entropic Propulsion innovation. Prediction: asymmetric entropy produces thrust at ~1 μN/kW. Distinguishing test: vary temperature at constant power. EPS force scales with T; photon pressure doesn't."
    },
    "philosophers": {
      "question": "Is this ontic structural realism made physical?",
      "answer": "Yes. RDT is explicitly relational: configurations σ have no intrinsic properties beyond relations (adjacency in Ω). Space, time, matter emerge from structure. This is Ladyman-style OSR with mathematical specificity."
    },
    "time_reversal": {
      "question": "Can RDT reverse time or entropy locally?",
      "answer": "No. What RDT claims: Time ≡ traversal direction; entropy conserved across M⁺ + M⁻; M⁻ has reversed arrow from our perspective. What RDT does NOT claim: local time reversal via entropy manipulation; access to M⁻ through local experiments."
    },
    "mirror_self": {
      "question": "Is there a 'me' in M⁻ doing things backwards?",
      "answer": "With the orientifold interpretation, M⁺ and M⁻ are dual DESCRIPTIONS, not places. Just as T-duality doesn't mean there's another you in a 'small radius universe' — it means the same physics has two equivalent mathematical descriptions. There's one physical reality with two dual formulations."
    },
    "what_is_outside_universe": {
      "question": "What is outside the universe?",
      "answer": "The Klein bottle topology dissolves this question. A Klein bottle has no outside — inside and outside are the same surface. The universe is finite (bounded configuration count) yet has no boundary (closed surface) and no outside (non-orientable). The question is revealed as malformed, like asking 'what's north of the North Pole?'"
    },
    "why_klein_bottle": {
      "question": "Why a Klein bottle specifically? How is it constructed?",
      "answer": "CPT symmetry (F4) requires a structure where CPT transformation connects 'both sides.' The construction is T⁴/ℤ₂ — a 4-torus quotiented by an orientation-reversing involution. This is analogous to how the 2D Klein bottle is T²/ℤ₂. The torus is already closed (no boundary), and the ℤ₂ quotient creates non-orientability. CPT is the ℤ₂ action itself."
    },
    "where_does_g_come_from": {
      "question": "Is G derived or empirical in RDT?",
      "answer": "DERIVED. G = ℏc/(m_H² · π⁶⁸). The hierarchy R = π³⁴ ≈ 10¹⁷ emerges from T⁴/ℤ₂ geometry, where 34 = 32 (tesseract edges) + 2 (twist identification). The only empirical inputs are m_H (Higgs mass), ℏ, and c. The ~10¹⁷ factor is pure topology."
    },
    "forces_from_geometry": {
      "question": "How do the four forces emerge from Klein bottle geometry?",
      "answer": "Forces are different path lengths on the Klein bottle: Strong (at self-intersection, α~1), Weak (near the twist, α~1/30), EM (loop around waist, α~1/137), Gravity (full circuit through Σ, α~10⁻³⁸). Gravity is weakest because it requires the longest path."
